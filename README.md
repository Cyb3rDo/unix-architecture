# Unix Architecture Diagrams
This repository maintains the source code files for creating diagrams of the
[Unix architecture evolution](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-architecture/index.html).
The diagrams are roughly based on data obtained from the
[evolution of Unix facilities](https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-history-man/index.html)
across the major Unix releases tracked by the
[Unix history repository](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo).
